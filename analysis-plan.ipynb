I had to change the sharing settings to be able to use it on this notebook and then I used the sheet ID and link and changed the format to a csv file.

    "My plan for the analysis is to drop some of the columns such as secondary author, illustrators, translators, and series name, and Date of Challenge so I can primarily focus on information of the location, the status, how the challenge was brought about and the most important information about what book was challenged and analyze patterns within that information. I would like to focus on the titles that are being challenged the most and the differences with the titles that are being banned because of legislative action vs a challenge that is happening more locally due to either administration or parents getting involved. I initially wanted to more focus on reoccuring themes in these book title, but have found that this would be more difficult because in the columns there is not really a column specifying or documenting why the book has been challenged or what the general content of the title is. I can only really make inferences of the content of these titles based on the titles and searching the synopsis of individual titles, which is not really enough to prove anything or do an analysis on. If there was not over 3,000 titles maybe I could have recorded the data onto the sheet myself."

    "This is only a very small portion of the data, which is in alphabetical order by title, if you look at these titles all of the legislative actions take place in Missouri, which makes sense because Missouri has a law banning books with sexually explicit content in schools that was actually passed in 2022 so around the time a lot of these books were banned. What is interesting to me is that if it was a state wide law you would think that these books would be banned across many more districts if it was like a legislative problem, but I assume it is because that was the district that actually had those books in possession while other districts never had those accessible to begin with. Another idea I have is to possibly put the specific information/description of the law in this notebook. I think that might be interesting because many say that the language of this law is very vague and the ACLU actually sued them over the vague language so I think that could be interesting to delve into."
